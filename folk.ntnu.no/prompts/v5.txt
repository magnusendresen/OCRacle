MAIN INSTRUCTIONS:

FORMAT TASK TEXT FOR KATEX RENDERING IN HTML:

Use visual answer boxes \boxed{\phantom{0}} to indicate where users should write answers.

Include the entire formatted text within a code block for easy copying.

Process each pre-extracted task text individually (one by one).

SUBTASK FORMATTING:

Each numbered subtask (e.g., "2. Find eigenvalues...") must appear on a new line.

Avoid combining multiple subtasks on the same line.

MATHEMATICAL TEXT FORMATTING:

Block Math: Use \[ ... \] for standalone mathematical expressions.

Inline Math: Use \( ... \) for math within text lines.

Matrices: Format using \begin{bmatrix} ... \end{bmatrix} with rows separated by \\.

ANSWER BOXES:

Indicate empty fields for user input using \boxed{\phantom{0}}.
Example: Re(z) = \boxed{\phantom{0}}, \quad Im(z) = \boxed{\phantom{0}}.

TASK POINTS:

Always specify "Maximum points: X" at the bottom of the task, on a new line.

JSON STRUCTURE:

Represent each processed task as a JSON object.

Example structure:
{
    "collection": [
        {
            "exam": "H24",
            "task": 7,
            "topic": "Complex Numbers",
            "task_text": "Examine the complex number \( z = 4 - 2i \)...",
            "max_points": 7
        }
    ]
}
LANGUAGE SELECTION:

Assume English (lang='eng') for all pre-processed text.

TEXT CLEANUP:

Remove irrelevant introductory text like: "Answer this in Inspera...".

Mark line breaks in regular text with \n.

TASK THEMES:

Map task themes based on syllabus categories provided, such as:

"Complex Numbers" => "Cartesian and Polar Forms".

"Linear Transformations" => "Matrix Algebra".

Simplify or abbreviate themes logically.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS:

Align options vertically and use aligned formatting:
\begin{aligned}
\text{a) } & x = y + z \\
\text{b) } & x = y - z \\
\text{c) } & x = z \\
\text{d) } & None of the above.
\end{aligned}

ERROR HANDLING:

Log errors internally without displaying messages to users.

Continue processing remaining tasks regardless of issues.

PRIORITIES:

VISUAL ANSWER BOXES:

Ensure all user-input fields are clearly marked.

LATEX FORMATTING:

Use only necessary LaTeX for clarity and conciseness.

LANGUAGE AND STYLE:

Translate tasks into Bokm√•l where applicable, adhering to specific translation rules.

Avoid excessive LaTeX escape characters or redundancy.

JSON VALIDATION:

Ensure all output JSON structures are valid and parsable.

FAITHFULNESS TO ORIGINAL TEXT:

Retain the integrity of the task text and structure without oversimplification.
