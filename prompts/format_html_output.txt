Format and structure:
- Format this exam task as a valid HTML string for use in a JavaScript variable.
- Use <p>...</p> for all text paragraphs.
- If there are subtasks, begin each subtask with "n)" without quotation marks, and n replaced by the actual subtask letter.
- Do not explain, summarize, or add anything outside the HTML.
- Output must be usable directly in text processing.
- Do not add any other text or explanation.
- Do not add any HTML tags except <p>...</p>.
- Be sure to include spaces and line breaks where appropriate—the formatting should look clean and readable.
- Change wording such as "See the figure below." to "See the figure above." since images always come before the task text.

Task points:
- If there is one single task, end the text with a separate line stating the maximum points exactly as Maks poeng: X (replace X with the number).
- If there are multiple tasks and each task has its own amount of points, write the points per task exactly as Xp. (replace X with the number) directly at the end of each subtask title.
- If the task in its entirety gives a total of e.g. 5 points, do not write 5p at the end of each subtask, only if each task is specified to have its own amount of points.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT write "```html" and "```" or "const oppgaveTekst=`" and "`;" or similar around the text, since your response is processed as a string by JavaScript and inserted directly into HTML.

Mathematical content:
- Use LaTeX compatible with MathJax.
- Use $$...$$ for display math.
- Use $...$ for inline math. Use inline math for ALL numbers or symbols inline.
- Use <b></b> for ALL numbers AND units, and nothing else. Numbers and units both together and alone should be wrapped. E.G <b>9,81 N</b>, <b>N = mg</b>, <b>h = 20 m</b>. 
- Use a single backslash for LaTeX commands (e.g., \frac, \sqrt).
- Do not use \( ... \) or \[ ... \].
- Do not double-escape backslashes.
- Make sure that e.g. infty, omega, theta, etc. are properly formatted as their respective symbols.


Code and programming:
- If the task text contains code, preserve it exactly inside <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>.
- If the code contains multiple-choice logic, write e.g. "X = ?" or "return ?" directly in the code. Then list each alternative in a separate code box.
- If the code is a single line (e.g., in multiple-choice), wrap that line in <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre> as well—do not show it as plain text.
- If the code contains mathematical expressions (e.g., f(x), $f(x + h)$, etc.), do not try to blend it into the code. Instead:
  - Place code inside <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>
  - Place math inside <div class="math">...</div> using MathJax-compatible LaTeX (e.g., inline $f(x)$ or block $$f(x + h) - f(x)$$)
- If the task has subquestions (e.g., a), b), c)) and each contains code or math, format each as:
  <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>
  <div class="math">...</div> (if applicable)
- Preserve all syntax and line breaks exactly as they appear in the original text. Remember that Python is extremely indentation-sensitive, so format accordingly.
- Only use code formatting if the task actually has code in it, not for regular math tasks that have nothing to do with programming.

Multiple choice:
- Present the options as an ordered list using <ol type="A"><li>...</li></ol>.
- Do not include any extra number or letter inside the option text itself—the list marker provides the label. Remember that <li></li> automatically adds letters, so do not place numering letters inside of the list as well.
- The task statement itself should be outside the list in a regular <p> tag.
- If the choices are lines of code, place each one inside <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre> within its <li>.
- Do not describe graphs, you are only used for text analysis, so do not make up anything regarding figures - let them speak for themselves. 



Tasks requiring calculation, proof, or explanation:
- For regular tasks that require proving, calculating, or explaining, also follow these rules:
  - Keep paragraphs short and use multiple <p> elements rather than a single long block. 
  - Introduce each subtask with the label a), b), and so on.

OCR errors and interpretation:
- You are allowed to make certain assumptions about OCR artifacts in the text, such as interpreting \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt as a likely error for a single square root.

Summary (read carefully before output):
- Output must be valid HTML with only <p>, <pre class="code-box"><code>, <div class="math">, <ol type="A">, <li>.
- Never include ``` fences or const oppgaveTekst=....
- Use many short <p> paragraphs, not one block.
- Math: $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display, <b> around all numbers and units' declaration. No \( or \[. No double-escaped backslashes.
- Code: preserve exactly, wrap in <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>. Math stays outside code.
- Multiple choice: <ol type="A"><li>...</li></ol>. No extra letters inside <li>.
- Points: "Maks poeng: X" at end of the text block, or inline for each task if specified. 
- Replace "figure below" → "figure above".
- Allow fixing trivial OCR errors (e.g. sqrt duplication).

Final reminder:
DO NOT output anything except the clean HTML body.
MAKE MANY PARAGRAPHS WITH THE HTML.
DO NOT include wrappers or explanations.
