Format og struktur:
- Format this exam task as a valid HTML string for use in a JavaScript variable.
- Use <p>...</p> for all text paragraphs.
- Use <h3>a)</h3>, <h3>b)</h3> etc for subtask labels if present.
- Do not explain, summarize, or add anything outside the HTML.
- Output must be usable directly inside const oppgaveTekst = `<the content here>`.
- Do not add any other text or explanation.
- Do not add any HTML tags outside the <p>...</p> and <h3>...</h3> tags.
- Be sure to include spaces and newlines where appropriate, the formatting is supposed to look proper.

Matematisk innhold:
- Use MathJax-compatible LaTeX.
- Wrap display math in $$...$$.
- Wrap inline math in $...$. Use inline math for ALL numbers or symbols inline.
- Use a single backslash for LaTeX commands (e.g., \frac, \sqrt).
- Do not use \( ... \) or \[ ... \].
- Do not double-escape backslashes.
- Make sure that e.g. infty, omega, theta, etc. are properly formatted as their respective symbols.

Kode og programmering:
- If the task text contains programming code, keep it verbatim inside <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>. \
- If the code itself has multiple choice answers, write e.g. "X = ?" or return ?" in the full code. Then list each alternative as a separate code box.
- If any code is on a single line, e.g. in multiple choice tasks, also wrap each line in <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre> instead of leaving it as plain text.
- If the code contains math expressions (e.g. f(x), $f(x + h)$, etc.), do not try to combine it into code. Instead:
  - Put code in <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>
  - Put math in <div class="math">...</div> using MathJax-compatible LaTeX (e.g., inline $f(x)$ or block $$f(x + h) - f(x)$$)
- If the task has subquestions (e.g. a), b), c)), and each contains code or math, format each as:
  <h3>a)</h3>
  <pre class="code-box"><code>...</code></pre>
  <div class="math">...</div> (if relevant)
- Keep all syntax and line breaks exactly as they appear in the original task. Remember that python is extremely strict to indentation, so format accordingly.
 

Flervalg:
- For multiple choice tasks with text or image alternatives, also follow these rules:
  - Present the alternatives as an ordered list using <ol><li>.
  - Prefix each alternative with the corresponding letter label inside <b> tags (A, B, C, ...).
  - Keep the statement of the task itself outside the list in normal <p> tags.

Oppgaver som krever utregning, bevis eller forklaring:
- For regular tasks that require proving, calculating or explaining, also follow these rules:
  - Keep paragraphs short and use multiple <p> elements rather than a single long block.
  - Introduce each subtask with its label using <h3>a)</h3>, <h3>b)</h3> and so on.

OCR-feil og tolkning:
- You are allowed to make som assumptions about OCR artifacts in the text, such as \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt most likely being an error for a single square root.
