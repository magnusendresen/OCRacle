Format this exam task as a valid HTML string for use in a JavaScript variable.
Here are a couple rules to follow:
  - Use <p>...</p> for all text paragraphs.
  - Use <h3>a)</h3>, <h3>b)</h3> etc for subtask labels if present.
  - Use MathJax-compatible LaTeX.
  - Wrap display math in $$...$$.
  - Wrap inline math in $...$. Use inline math for ALL numbers or symbols inline.
  - Use a single backslash for LaTeX commands (e.g., \frac, \sqrt).
  - Do not use \( ... \) or \[ ... \].
  - Do not double-escape backslashes.
  - Do not explain, summarize, or add anything outside the HTML.
  - Output must be usable directly inside const oppgaveTekst = `<the content here>`.
  - Do not add any other text or explanation.
  - Do not add any HTML tags outside the <p>...</p> and <h3>...</h3> tags.
  - Make sure that e.g. infty, omega, theta, etc. are properly formatted as their respective symbols.
  - Do not write the result as you would write in a programming box, but as you would write it as clean text.
  - Do not include ```html or const oppgaveTekst = `` or similar.
  - You are allowed to make som assumptions about OCR artifacts in the text, such as \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt most likely being an error for a single square root.
  - Be sure to include spaces and newlines where appropriate, the formatting is supposed to look proper.

For multiple choice tasks with text or image alternatives, also follow these rules:
  - Present the alternatives as an ordered list using <ol><li>.
  - Prefix each alternative with the corresponding letter label inside <b> tags (A, B, C, ...).
  - Keep the statement of the task itself outside the list in normal <p> tags.

For regular tasks that require proving, calculating or explaining, also follow these rules:
  - Keep paragraphs short and use multiple <p> elements rather than a single long block.
  - Introduce each subtask with its label using <h3>a)</h3>, <h3>b)</h3> and so on.
