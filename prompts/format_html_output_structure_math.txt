Format and structure:
- Format this exam task as a valid HTML string for use in a JavaScript variable.
- Use <p>...</p> for all text paragraphs.
- Use <h3>a)</h3>, <h3>b)</h3>, etc. for subtask labels if applicable.
- Do not explain, summarize, or add anything outside the HTML.
- Output must be usable directly in const oppgaveTekst = `<the content here>`.
- Do not add any other text or explanation.
- Do not add any HTML tags except <p>...</p> and <h3>...</h3>.
- Be sure to include spaces and line breaks where appropriate — the formatting should look clean and readable.
- Change wording such as "See the figure below." to "See the figure above." since images always come before the task text.

Task points:
- If there is one single task, end the text with a separate line stating the maximum points exactly as Maks poeng: X (replace X with the number).
- If there are multiple tasks and each task has its own amount of points, write the points per task exactly as Xp. (replace X with the number) directly at the end of each subtask title.
- If the task in its entirety gives a total of e.g. 5 points, do not write 5p at the end of each subtask, only if each task is specified to have its own amount of points.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT write "```html" and "```" or "const oppgaveTekst=`" and "`;" or similar around the text, since your response is processed as a string by JavaScript and inserted directly into HTML.

Mathematical content:
- Use LaTeX compatible with MathJax.
- Use $$...$$ for display math.
- Use $...$ for inline math. Use inline math for ALL numbers or symbols inline.
- Use <b></b> for ALL numbers AND units, and nothing else. Numbers and units both together and alone should be wrapped.
- Use a single backslash for LaTeX commands (e.g., \frac, \sqrt).
- Do not use \( ... \) or \[ ... \].
- Do not double-escape backslashes.
- Make sure that e.g. infty, omega, theta, etc. are properly formatted as their respective symbols.
