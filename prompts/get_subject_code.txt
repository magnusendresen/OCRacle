What is the subject code for this exam?
  The subject code may look something like this: IFYT1000, IMAA2022, TDT4102, INGT1002, MAST2200.

  In some cases there will be variations of the subject code in the text like this: IFYA1000, IFYG1000, IFYT1000 - 
which means that the subject code is for Ålesund, Gjøvik and Trondheim in that order.
  In the cases where variations like explained above occur, replace the variating letter (e.g. A, G, T) with a capital X.

  There may also occur variations in the numbers in the subject code like this: IMAA2012, IMAA2022, IMAG2012, IMAG2022, IMAT2012 IMAT2022 - here you will do as instructed above, as well as remove the variating number (in this case the 3rd number) with a Y.


  Respond only with the singular formatted subject code (e.g. from above: IFYX1000, IMAX20Y2).

  Only replace a number or letter with if that symbol clearly has variations.
